This program is about Deep-Q-learning implementation for lunar landing in which the lander has to land in between the flags

Steps to Implement Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Landing

Setup the Environment:
Install Gymnasium and other necessary libraries.
Initialize the Lunar Lander environment.

Define the Neural Network:
Create a neural network to approximate the Q-value function. Typically, a simple feedforward network with a few hidden layers works well.

Experience Replay:
Use a replay buffer to store experiences (state, action, reward, next state).
Sample random mini-batches from the buffer to break the correlation between consecutive experiences.

Target Network:
Use a separate target network to stabilize training.
Update the target network weights periodically to match the main network.

Training Loop:
For each episode:
Initialize the environment and get the initial state.
For each step in the episode:
Select an action using an epsilon-greedy policy.
Execute the action in the environment.
Store the experience in the replay buffer.
Sample a mini-batch from the replay buffer.
Compute the target Q-value using the target network.
Perform a gradient descent step to minimize the loss between the predicted Q-value and the target Q-value.
Periodically update the target network.

Hyperparameters:
Define and tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, discount factor, epsilon decay, buffer size, and batch size.
